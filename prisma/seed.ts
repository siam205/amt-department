/**
 * Seed — brings an empty database up to the minimum the site needs to render.
 *
 * Two rows are not optional: `getDepartmentIdentity` and
 * `getUniversityIdentity` throw when their singleton is missing, so without
 * them every public page is a 500 rather than an empty one. Every other table
 * returns an array and renders as an empty section, so the rest of the content
 * belongs in the admin panel, not here.
 *
 * Safe to run more than once. The identities are upserts that only fill a
 * missing row — an existing one is left exactly as the admin last saved it,
 * because re-running a seed must never quietly undo somebody's edits. The
 * super admin is skipped when the email already exists.
 *
 *   npm run db:seed
